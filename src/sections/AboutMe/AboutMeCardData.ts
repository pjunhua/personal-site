I'm a pretty quiet guy, often keeping to myself, a people observer, if you will.\n\nThat doesn't mean I won't speak up at all though, if it's a close group of friends/colleagues I can turn into a bit of a yappologist, especially if it's a common interest or when I'm teaching someone. In scenarios like work or group assignments where things need to get done, I might even take the initiative.\n\nI also like creating things that are unique to me, probably to a point that's too unhealthy though. ðŸ˜… I usually avoid the popular choice, when coding I'd rather use my unoptimised scuffed code over copy-pasting a completed product, even in games I would use an anti-meta option. It's not all bad though, this obsession also led to me making my own website and YouTube channel, which I'm still very proud of!`,

The videos I like watching range from korean variety shows, to anime, to gameplay videos as well.\n\nWhen it comes to video games, I really like strategic card games (Pokemon Pocket/Master Duel), Overwatch, and gacha games. Though I haven't played much of it recently, I also enjoy single-player story games like Yakuza, Fallout, and Mafia, to name a few.\n\nEvery now and then I also play around with photo and video editing. I have the most experience with Photoshop and Filmora, but I also have experience using Vegas & Premiere Pro in the past.",
